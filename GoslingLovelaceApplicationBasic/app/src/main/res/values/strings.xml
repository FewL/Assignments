    <string name="gosling">James Gosling is a software expert. Born in Canada on May 19, 1955, James Gosling is one of the co-founders of Java programming language. He is generally recognized as \"the father of Java\".
By the age of 12, he had been able to design video games to help his neighbors repair their harvesters. In 1977, he received a bachelor\'s degree in computer science from the University of Calgary in Canada and a doctorate in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1983.
The title of the doctoral thesis is \"The Algebraic Manipulation of Constraints\". After graduation, I worked at IBM and designed the NeWS system of IBM\'s first generation workstation, but it was not taken seriously. Later transferred to Sun Company. In 1990, in collaboration with Patrick Naughton and Mike Sheridan, the Green Project developed a language called Oak, which was renamed Java. At the end of 1994, James Gosling presented Java programs at the Conference on Technology, Education and Design in Silicon Valley. In 2000, Java became the most popular computer language in the world.
Sun was acquired by Oracle in April 2009. Gosling announced his departure from Oracle in April 2010.
On March 29, 2011, Gosling announced on his personal blog that he would join Google.
On August 30, 2011, just a few months after joining Google, Gosling announced on his personal blog that he would leave Google to join liquid Robotics, a start-up company engaged in marine robotics research, as chief software architect.
Typesafe Inc., a Scala company founded in May 2011, was hired as a consultant.</string>
    <string name="lovelace">Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage\'s proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a \"computing machine\" and one of the first computer programmers.\nLovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron and his wife Anne Isabella \"Annabella\" Milbanke, Lady Wentworth. All of Byron\'s other children were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later. He commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, \"Is thy face like thy mother\'s my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?\". He died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada\'s interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father\'s perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request. She was often ill in her childhood. Ada married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.</string>
